  ## Description
  This app can be used to write and save notes. It provides a simple and user-friendly interface, where a user can organize notes by title, store them for future use, or delete them. I have also created this app, in part, for the purpose of demonstrating my ability to create front-end and back-end components, using JavaScript, Node.js, NPM, and JSON.
